This algorithm solves the following problem : 
"given six numbers, find the calculations required in order to get the result"

for example : given the following : 1 2 3 4 5 6 = 7. the program will return one viable solution
:  ( 1 + 2 ) ( 3 + 3 ) ( 6 - 4 ) ( 2 * 6 ) ( 12 - 5 ) = 7

the program is run with python3 as so : python3 test.py "1 2 3 4 5 6 = 7"
